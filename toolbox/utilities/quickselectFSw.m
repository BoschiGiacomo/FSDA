% quickselectFSw finds the 100*p-th weighted order statistic for $0<p<1$
%
%<a href="matlab: docsearchFS('quickselectFSw')">Link to the help function</a>
%
% quickselectFSw generalises the calculation of the weighted median to a
% generic percentile $100pth (0<p<1)$. It finds the p-th weighted order
% statistic in the elements of a data vector $D$ considering the associated
% weights $W$. More precisely, the algorithm finds the element $D_{k^{*}}$
% that make the following difference as small as possible:
% $\sum_{i=1}^{k^{*}_{p} - 1} w_{i} - \sum_{i=k^{*}_{p}+1}^{n} w_{i}$.
% The linear algorithm used for the computation extends quickselectFS.
% REMARK: we also provide the mex counterpart, quickselectFSwmex; see the
% last example to understand how it works. 
%
%  Required input arguments:
%
%   D: Input data. Vector. A vector containing a set of $n$ data elements.
%      Data Types - double
%
%   W: Weights.  Vector. The vector contains a set of n positive weights.
%      It is not necessary that the weights sum to 1. 
%      Data Types - double
%
% Optional input arguments:
%
%   p: 100pth percentile ($0<p<1$). Scalar. A number between 0 and 1
%      indicating the fraction of total weights that should be considered
%      in partitioning the associated input data. Default is p=0.5, leading
%      to the weighted median.
%      Example - p,0.2
%      Data Types - double
%
% Output:
%
% kD    : weighted order statistic in D. Scalar. Element kstar in vector D
%         ($D(k^{*})$), for which we have $\sum_{i=1}^{k^{*}-1} w_i<=p$
%         and $\sum_{j=k^{*}+1}^{n} w_j<=1-p$.
%
% kW    : weight associated to kD. Scalar. Element kstar in vector W. The
%         weight partition around kW is optimal in the sense that the sum
%         of the weights on its left is as close as possible to $p$ and
%         those on its right account for the remaining $1-p$.
%
% kstar : the index of kD in D and of kW in W. Scalar. It is the position
%         of the weighted order statistic in the internal data and weight 
%         vectors, that is $D(k^{*})$ and $W(k^{*})$.
%
%
% Optional Output:
%
%   Ds  : Output vector. Array. At the and of the computation the vector
%         [D(:) , W(:)] is appropriately partitioned around kstar. It is
%         returned ordered in the interval (1:kstar-1,:). Remark: this
%         operation sorts only part of the array, but it can still slow
%         down the algorithm.
%
% More About:
%
%   quickselectFSw builds on quickselectFS, the algorithm used to find
%   order statistics. Data and weights are collapsed to a single vector
%   D=[D(:),W(:)] (point 2). The core part of quickselectFS is called on D
%   assuming that the weighted percentile is in position k=ceil(n*p) (point
%   3). This step permutes vector D so that the elements in positions
%   (1:k-1,:) are smaller than the element at position k. At this point we
%   check if the array fulfills the weighted median condition by Bleich and
%   Overton (1985) (point 5). If so, we stop computation (point 6.). If
%   not, we apply again the core part of quickselectFS on either D(1:k,:)
%   with k+1, or D(k:n,:) with k-1. The iteration will remove or add
%   weights in order to approach the optimality condition (see points 7,8
%   and 9). The process is iterated till success.
