 is very large it is necessary to preliminary understand the subset of
 variables which surely must be excluded before running the proper
 variable selection procedure. This procedure estimates a univariate
 regression model (with intercept) between each column of X and the
 response. Just the variables that have an R2 greater than (or a
 $p$-value smaller than) a certain threshold in the univariate regressions
 are retained. The p-value or R2 threshold are based on robust univariate
 models (with intercept), but the unrobust models can be chosen using
 option thresh. Option fsr enables the user to select the preferred robust
 regression procedure.</P></html>
