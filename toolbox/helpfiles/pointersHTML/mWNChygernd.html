 translation into MATLAB of the corresponding C++ function of Fog (2008).
 The notation which is used in mWNChygernd and the order of the arguments
 is the one of MATLAB hyge. The notation which is used inside
 CMultiWalleniusNCHypergeometricrnd is the original one of Fog.

 To illustrate the meaning of Wallenius and Fisher' function parameters, let's use
 the classical biased urn example, with $K$ red balls and  $M-K$ white balls,
 totalling $M$ balls. $n$ balls are drawn at random from the urn
 without replacement. Each red ball has the weight $\omega_{1}$, and
 each white ball has the weight $\omega_{2}$; the probability ratio of red over
 white balls is then given by $odds = \omega_{1} / \omega_{2}$. Note that
 the odds are fixed once and for all during the drawings.
 
 If the balls are taken one by one, the probability (say $p_1$) that the
 first ball picked is red is equal to the weight fraction of red balls:
 \[
 p_1= \frac{K w_1}{K w_1 + (M-K) w_2} 
 \] 
 In the Wallenius distribution the
 probability that the second ball picked is red depends on whether the
 first ball was red or white. If the first ball was red then the above
 formula is used with $K$ reduced by one. If the first ball was not red
 then the above formula is used with $M-K$ reduced by one. The number of red
 balls that we get in this experiment is a random variable with Wallenius'
 noncentral hypergeometric distribution.

 The important fact that distinguishes Wallenius' distribution is that
 there is competition between the balls. The probability that a particular
 ball is taken in a particular draw depends not only on its own weight,
 but also on the total weight of the competing balls that remain in the
 urn at that moment. And the weight of the competing balls depends on the
 outcomes of all preceding draws. In the Fisher model, the fates of the
 balls are independent and there is no dependence between draws. One may
 as well take all $n$ balls at the same time. Each ball has no "knowledge"
 of what happens to the other balls.
 More formally, if the total number $n$ of balls taken is known then the
 conditional distribution of the number of taken red balls for given $n$ is
 Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution. 

 These two distributions have important applications in evolutionary
 biology and population genetics. If animals of a particular species are
 competing for a limited food resource so that individual animals are
 dying one by one until there is enough food for the remaining animals,
 and if there are different variants of animals with different chances of
 finding food, then we can expect the animals that die to follow a
 Wallenius noncentral hypergeometric distribution. Fisher’s noncentral
 hypergeometric distribution may be used instead of Wallenius distribution
 in cases where the fates of the individual animals are independent and
 the total number of survivors is known or controlled as part of
 a simulation experiment (Fog 2008).
 
 Wallenius  distribution is a general model of biased sampling. Fisher’s
 noncentral hypergeometric distribution is used for statistical tests on
 contingency tables where the marginals are fixed (McCullagh and Nelder,
 1983).
 
 The multivariate Fishers and Wallenius noncentral hypergeometric
 distribution, are referred to the case where the type of different balls
 is greater than 2 and each ball has a different probability. 

 The two distributions are both equal to the (multivariate) hypergeometric
 distribution when the odds ratio is 1.</P><h2>References</h2><P>Fog, A. (2008), Calculation Methods for Wallenius' Noncentral Hypergeometric
