 Mahalanobis distances measure the distance of a sample unit from the mean
 of a distribution, taking into account the correlation between the units
 in the covariance matrix. If $x$ is an observation from a multivariate
 distribution with mean $\mu$ and covariance $\Sigma$, the Mahalanobis
 squared distance (MSD) of $x$ from $\mu$ is $D^{2}=(x − \mu)^{t}
 \Sigma^{-1} (x − \mu)$. When $x$ is from a $v$-dimensional multivariate
 normal with known mean and covariance, the population MSD is distributed
 as a chi-squared $\chi_{v}^{2}$ random variable with $\nu$ degrees of
 freedom (Mardia et al, 1979). Then, to test the deviation of an
 observation from the multivariate normal assumption we can compare its
 MSD with an appropriate quantile of the chi-squared distribution: the
 observation will be considered an outlier if the associated $D^{2}$ value
 is larger than the critical value of the chi-squared distribution. There
 are known limitations to the application of this cut-off, for example
 when the sample is high dimensional and its size is not sufficiently
 high. In this case the distribution of the sample MSD is a scaled Beta
 distribution (Gnanadesikan and Kettenring, 1972). For continuous
 Student-t samples, which account for heavy-tailed distributions, the
 appropriate cutoff value depends from a standard Beta distribution with
 shape parameters $v/2$ and $\nu/2$, as shown by Barabesi et al (2023).
