					In the example of Kleiber and 
				Zeileis (2008, p. 142), the number of a person's extramarital 
				sexual inter-courses ("affairs") in the past year is regressed 
				on the person's age, number of years married, religiousness, 
				occupation, and won rating of the marriage. The dependent 
				variable is left-censored at zero and not right-censored. Hence 
				this is a standard Tobit model which be estimated by functions

age-adjusted mortality from all causes, counted as deaths per 100,000 population ('Mortality').
The explanatory variables are listed below: <br>Precip: Mean annual precipitation (in inches)
		<br>Humidity: Percent relative humidity (annual average at 1:00pm)<br>JanTemp: Mean January temperature (degrees Fahrenheit)
		<br>JulyTemp: Mean July temperature (degrees Fahrenheit)
<br>Over65: Percentage of the population aged 65 years or over
<br>House: Population per household
<br>Educ: Median number of school years completed for persons 25 years or older
		<br>Sound: Percentage of housing that is sound with all facilities
<br>Density: Population density (in persons per square mile of urbanized area)
		<br>NonWhite: Percentage of population that is nonwhite
<br>WhiteCol: Percentage of employment in white collar occupations

		<br>HC: Relative pollution potential of hydrocarbons
<br>NOX: Relative pollution potential of oxides of nitrogen<br>SO2: Relative pollution potential of sulfur dioxide


		<br>The explanatory variables include four climate variables, eight 
		demographic variables and three pollution related variables. ``Relative 
		pollution potential'' is the product of the tons emitted per day per 
		square kilometer and a factor correcting for the area dimension and 
		exposure. The three pollution variables are skewed.</td>

        (y1) of 47 stars of the CYG OB1 cluster that one can observe in the
        direction of the constellation Cygnus. Both variables are in the
        logaritmic scale (base 10). The temperature is the explanatory
        variable. The dataset is interesting from the statistical point of view
        because contains four strong outliers (observations 11, 20, 30, and
        34), correponding to giant stars, which affect the OLS regression
        parameters. Robustness aspects linked to this dataset are discussed in

        give the number of cycles to failure of a worsted yarn under cycles of
        repeated loading. The results are from a single 3<sup>3</sup> factorial
        experiment. The three factors and their levels are: <br>
        - x1: length of test specimen (25, 30, 35 cm) <br>
        - x2: amplitude of loading cycle (8, 9, 10 mm) <br>
        - x3: load (40, 45, 50 g). <br>
        The number of cycles to failure ranges from 90, for the shortest
        specimen subject to the most severe conditions, to 3,636 for
        observation 19 which comes from the longest specimen subjected to the
        mildest conditions. In their analysis Box and Cox(1964) recommend that
        the data be fitted after the log transformation of y. The FS plots
        explain the effect of the ordering of the data during the FS on the
