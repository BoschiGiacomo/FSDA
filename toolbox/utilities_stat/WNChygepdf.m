%WNChygepdf returns Wallenius' non-central hypergeometric probability density function
%
%<a href="matlab: docsearchFS('WNChygepdf')">Link to the help function</a>
%
% This function calls function  WalleniusNCHypergeometricpdf which is a
% translation into MATLAB of the corresponding C++ function of Fog (2008).
% The notation which is used in WNChygepdf and the order of the arguments
% is the one of MATLAB hyge. The notation which is used inside
% WalleniusNCHypergeometricpdf is the original one of Fog.
%
% To illustrate the meaning of Wallenius and Fisher' function parameters, let's use
% the classical biased urn example, with $K$ red balls and  $M-K$ white balls,
% totalling $M$ balls. $n$ balls are drawn at random from the urn
% without replacement. Each red ball has the weight $\omega_{1}$, and
% each white ball has the weight $\omega_{2}$; the probability ratio of red over
% white balls is then given by $odds = \omega_{1} / \omega_{2}$. Note that
% the odds are fixed once and for all during the drawings.
% 
% If the balls are taken one by one, the probability (say $p_1$) that the
% first ball picked is red is equal to the weight fraction of red balls:
% \[
% p_1= \frac{K w_1}{K w_1 + (M-K) w_2} 
% \] 
% In the Wallenius distribution the
% probability that the second ball picked is red depends on whether the
% first ball was red or white. If the first ball was red then the above
% formula is used with $K$ reduced by one. If the first ball was not red
% then the above formula is used with $M-K$ reduced by one. The number of red
% balls that we get in this experiment is a random variable with Wallenius'
% noncentral hypergeometric distribution.
%
% The important fact that distinguishes Wallenius' distribution is that
% there is competition between the balls. The probability that a particular
% ball is taken in a particular draw depends not only on its own weight,
% but also on the total weight of the competing balls that remain in the
% urn at that moment. And the weight of the competing balls depends on the
% outcomes of all preceding draws. In the Fisher model, the fates of the
% balls are independent and there is no dependence between draws. One may
% as well take all $n$ balls at the same time. Each ball has no "knowledge"
% of what happens to the other balls.
% More formally, if the total number $n$ of balls taken is not known before
% the experiment (i.e n is determined just after the experiment), then the
% conditional distribution of the number of taken red balls for given $n$
% is Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution.
%
% These two distributions have important applications in evolutionary
% biology and population genetics. If animals of a particular species are
% competing for a limited food resource so that individual animals are
% dying one by one until there is enough food for the remaining animals,
% and if there are different variants of animals with different chances of
% finding food, then we can expect the animals that die to follow a
% Wallenius noncentral hypergeometric distribution. Fisher’s noncentral
% hypergeometric distribution may be used instead of Wallenius distribution
% in cases where the fates of the individual animals are independent and
% the total number of survivors is known or controlled as part of
% a simulation experiment (Fog 2008).
% 
% Wallenius  distribution is a general model of biased sampling. Fisher’s
% noncentral hypergeometric distribution is used for statistical tests on
% contingency tables where the marginals are fixed (McCullagh and Nelder,
% 1983).
% 
% The multivariate Fishers and Wallenius noncentral hypergeometric
% distribution, are referred to the case where the type of different balls
% is greater than 2 and each ball has a different probability. 
%
% The two distributions are both equal to the (multivariate) hypergeometric
% distribution when the odds ratio is 1.

%                  The size of Wpdf is the common size of the input
